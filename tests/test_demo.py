"""Tests driven by the synthetic statement.

The real archive is the better oracle where it reaches, and most of the suite
is parametrized over it. But it holds two option fills from one order with
nothing closed, so whole paths have never seen data: closed round trips,
`leg_count > 1`, expiry and assignment dispositions, a roll, a 0DTE trade, a
commission credit, and more than one calendar year. Those are what this module
covers.

The generator is treated as code under test, not as a trusted fixture: the
money arithmetic is asserted to be internally consistent, so a bug in the
generator surfaces here rather than quietly weakening every test that uses it.
